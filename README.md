## About the Pomodoro Technique

yoTime can be used in the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. The timer is used to divide the time into a 25-minute working time and a 5-minute rest time. During the work, focus on the work and do not allow you to do anything irrelevant to the task. Things that help:

-Concentrate and reduce interruptions
-Promote task division, enhance decision-making awareness, and improve task enforceability
-Awaken and lasting incentives, consolidate the determination to achieve goals and reduce time anxiety



## Easter egg

yoTime stems from the need for time and energy management in your daily work. With the increase of age and long hours of overtime work (1 and 2 hours per sitting), the body is in poor condition every day. Strongly prompted products, I hope you like it, welcome to feedback questions and comments in issue.

In the future, we plan to add data recording function to better record working time.

... More features, stay tuned!
